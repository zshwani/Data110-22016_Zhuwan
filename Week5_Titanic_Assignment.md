# Assignment: Uncovering Insights from the Titanic Dataset

## Objective:
This assignment focuses on using the Titanic dataset to extract meaningful insights from the data. Instead of just plotting graphs, the emphasis will be on interpreting the results, asking thoughtful questions, and connecting findings to real-world scenarios.

## Instructions:
You are required to perform a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset and draw meaningful conclusions from the data. Use visualizations to support your claims, but focus primarily on interpreting the data.

## Assignment Outline

### Part 1: Understanding the Dataset
1. **Task 1: Dataset Overview**  
   - Briefly describe the Titanic dataset. What kind of information is contained in each column?  
   *Deliverable*: Write a paragraph summarizing the dataset based on your exploration.

2. **Task 2: Missing Data Analysis**  
   - Identify which columns have missing data and the percentage of missing values.  
   *Question*: How might missing data impact your analysis?

### Part 2: Demographic Analysis
3. **Task 3: Age Distribution**
   - Plot a histogram of the age distribution.  
   *Question*: Are there any trends in the age distribution? How might age have impacted survival?

4. **Task 4: Gender and Survival**
   - Create a bar plot showing the number of male and female passengers.  
   - Create a second plot showing survival rates based on gender.  
   *Question*: What can you infer about survival rates among men and women?

### Part 3: Class and Fare Analysis
5. **Task 5: Passenger Class Distribution**  
   - Create a bar plot showing the number of passengers in each class (`Pclass`).   
   *Question*: Is there a relationship between passenger class and fare? What insights can you draw from this?

6. **Task 6: Class and Survival**  
   - Create a bar plot showing survival rates for each passenger class.  
   *Question*: What patterns do you observe in survival rates across different classes? How does this reflect the historical context of the Titanic tragedy?

### Part 4: Advanced Insight

7. **Task 8: Passenger Location Analysis (Optional)**  
   - Investigate the `Embarked` column to explore if the port of embarkation influenced survival rates.  
   *Question*: Are there differences in survival based on where passengers boarded the Titanic?

### Key Focus:
- **Emphasis on interpretation**: For each plot or analysis, focus on interpreting what the data shows, connecting it to broader questions about the Titanic disaster.
- **Critical thinking**: Think critically about the limitations of the dataset, potential biases (such as missing data), and how these factors might influence conclusions.
- **Historical context**: Tie findings to the historical context of the Titanic (e.g., socioeconomic factors, gender roles at the time).

### Submission Requirements:
- Submit your analysis as a Jupyter notebook.
- Include visualizations with brief descriptions and detailed answers to each question.
- Ensure your code is well-commented and clean.
