## Task 1: Basic Bar Chart for Crime Rates in 2023

In this task, you will create a **bar chart** showing the offense rates per 100,000 people for each type of crime in 2023.

### Instructions:
- Create a bar chart for crime rates in 2023.
- Customize the bar colors and add gridlines.
- Label the axes and add a title.

---

## Task 2: Change in Crime Rates (2022 vs. 2023) with Unique Colors

In this task, you will create a **horizontal bar chart** that visualizes the **percentage change** in offense rates from 2022 to 2023 for each crime type. Each bar should have a unique color for better distinction.

### Instructions:
- Create a horizontal bar chart showing the **change in offense rates**.
- Assign a unique color to each crime type.
- Label the axes and add a title.

### Additional Instructions:
1. **Why does this bar graph make more sense than Task 1's bar graph?**
   - Think about how **absolute numbers** (like total crime rates) might be misleading compared to **percentage changes**.
   - Explain why seeing the **change** over time is more insightful than just seeing the total number of offenses for a single year.
   
2. **Improve the clarity of your bar graph**:
   - Create **multiple versions** of the bar chart for Task 2, each time making the chart more **clear and readable**.
   - Experiment with different color schemes, labels, and gridlines.
   - In each iteration, focus on improving the ease with which someone can quickly understand the trends in crime rates.


## Optional Task: Combined Bar Chart for Crime Rates in 2022 and 2023

In this optional task, you will create a **combined bar chart** that shows the crime rates for both **2022 and 2023**. 

### Instructions:
- Calculate the **crime rates for 2022** based on the 2023 values and the percentage changes provided.
- Create a **combined bar chart** that compares the crime rates for 2022 and 2023 for each offense type.
- Use different colors to distinguish between the years 2022 and 2023.
- Label the axes and add a title.
- Add a legend to indicate which bars represent which year.

### Remark:
- You are required to complete this task in **Google Colab**. Name your file **Data110_YourName_Week4**. 
- When submitting your assignment, upload your code, calculations, and final bar chart in the Google Colab Notebook.
